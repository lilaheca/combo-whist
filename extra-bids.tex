					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Zerofication} & -4 &
					&
					If the bid is completed all players' but the declarer's scores are reset to zero.
					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Theft} & -3 &
					&
					The declarer may some time during the game assign a trick to themself, regardless of what cards were played in the trick. This must be announced before any card in the next trick has been played. After the declarer has brought home the trick, it is their turn to lead.
					\\ \hline

					&
					If this bid is completed it is marked by a P, a potential, in the declarers column.
