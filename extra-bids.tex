					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Zerofication} & -4 &
					&
					If the bid is completed all layers' but the declarer's scores are set to zero.
					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Thief} & -3 &
					&
					The declarer may some time during the play assign a book to itself, regardless of whether he has the highest card or trump in the led suite. This must be announced before any card in the next book has been played. To announce this, the declarer must shout ``Thief!''. After the declarer has brought home the book it is his turn to lead.
					\\ \hline

					&
					If this bid is completed it is marked by a P, a potential, in the protocol.
					\\ \hline

					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Send} & -1 &
					&
					All players send 3 cards to in a direction the declarer decides (to the right, to the left or to the player opposite to oneself).
					\\ \hline

					The aces are no longer the highest cards, but the lowest.

					\textit{Open Hand} &

					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Open Trump} & 1 &
					non-trump bids, \newline \textit{Grill}, \newline \textit{Open Hand} &
					The declarer must play with open trump cards. That is, all of the declarer’s trump cards must be shown to all players during the play. If this bid is bid in combination with the additional bid ”Atelier” the atelier must contain no trump cards.

					\textit{Extended Bid} & 2 &
					&
					This bid may only be bid if the declarer has completed the additional bid ”Potential”. When it is bid, one ”P” that the declarer has gathered through completing ”Potential” is crossed. Several ``Extended bids'' may be included in one combination bid.
					\\ \hline
					
					\textit{Master's Send} & 3 &
					non-trump bids &
